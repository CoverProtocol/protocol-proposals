# Protocol Proposals

For Cover Protocol to support minting of coverage for a new protocol, please folow steps before to get started.

## Step 1
Fork this [repo](https://github.com/CoverProtocol/protocol-proposals) and create a new folder under `protocols` titled `your_protocol`. Copy the contents from `protocols/example` into the newly created folder.

[Example](https://github.com/CoverProtocol/protocol-proposals/tree/main/protocols/example) folder contains `proposal.md`, `banner.png`, and `logo.png`. 

## Step 2
Fill out the `proposal.md` (under `your_protocol` folder) entirely and overwrite the `banner.png` and `logo.png` images with the correct images.
* `banner.png` has to be a *transparent* horizontal banner of your protocol
* `logo.png` has to be a *transparent* square logo of your protocol

## Step 3
Submit a pull request to [CoverProtocol/protocol-proposals](https://github.com/CoverProtocol/protocol-proposals/tree/main) and we will review the PR and notify you if there are any changes that need to be made before we add your protocol.
