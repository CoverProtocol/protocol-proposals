# Protocol Proposals

For Cover Protocol to support minting of coverage for a new protocol, please navigate to the [example](https://github.com/CoverProtocol/protocol-proposals/tree/main/protocols/example) folder. Inside will contain `Protocol Proposal.docx`, `banner.png`, and `logo.png`. 

# Step 1
Fork this [repo](https://github.com/CoverProtocol/protocol-proposals) and create a new folder under `protocols` titled `your_protocol`. Copy the contents from `protocols/example` into the newly created folder.

# Step 2
Fill out the `Protocol Proposal.docx` document (under `your_protocol` folder) entirely and overwrite the `banner.png` and `logo.png` images with the correct images.
* `banner.png` has to be a *transparent* horizontal banner of your protocol
* `logo.png` has to be a *transparent* square logo of your protocol

# Step 3
Submit a pull request to [CoverProtocol/protocol-proposals (github.com)](https://github.com/CoverProtocol/protocol-proposals/tree/main) and we will review the PR and notify you if there are any changes that need to be made before we add your protocol.
